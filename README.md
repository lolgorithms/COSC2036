# COSC2036 - Computer Game Design I - Algoma University

This was a fun course! I got to design and build my very own platform game, "**Qwerty Cat**".

I hope you like cats and know your alphabet... you'll be collecting letters and spelling with them! 😸 🔤➡️🆒

Click on the video below to learn more about the game I made for my final project:
